**INTRODUCTION TO RISC V BASIC KEYWORDS**
**INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE:**
**An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** is a set of instructions that a computer's central processing unit (CPU) can execute. It defines the interface between the hardware and software of a computer system, allowing software programs to communicate with and control the underlying hardware.

**RISC V**
RISC-V is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) designed to be simple, extensible, and versatile. Unlike many proprietary ISAs, RISC-V is developed collaboratively by the RISC-V Foundation and a wide community of contributors. The primary goals of RISC-V are to provide a foundation for a wide range of computing devices and applications, foster innovation in computer architecture, and encourage open collaboration in the industry.


**FROM APPS TO HARDWARE**
**APPS**:Application software is developed to cater to specific user needs and is typically distributed through various channels, including app stores, direct downloads from websites, or software packages included with hardware devices



**System software:** System software serves as an intermediary between hardware and application software, providing a stable and controlled environment for applications to run. It ensures resource allocation, memory management, process scheduling, and overall system stability. Without system software, computers would not be able to function effectively and run the applications that users rely on.

**Operating System:** The operating system is a fundamental piece of software that manages hardware resources and provides various services for both users and application programs. It controls tasks such as memory management, process scheduling, file system management, and user interface interaction. Examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

**Compiler:** A compiler is a type of software tool that translates high-level programming code written by developers into assembly-level language.

**assembler***An assembler is a software tool that translates assembly language code into machine code or binary code that can be directly executed by a computer's processor.

**RTL:** RTL serves as an abstraction level in the design process that represents the behavior of a digital circuit in terms of registers and the operations that transfer data between them.

**Hardware:** Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system or any electronic device. It encompasses all the tangible parts that make up a computing or electronic device and enable it to perform various tasks.
